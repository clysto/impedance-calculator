# Impedance Calculator

**Impedance Calculator** is an interactive web-based tool designed to assist with impedance matching in RF circuits. It enables users to visualize impedance transformations and design matching networks intuitively through an interactive Smith Chart.

This tool is suitable for engineers, students, and educators who need a quick and visual way to explore RF impedance behaviors. The calculator supports complex impedance input and provides real-time graphical feedback.
